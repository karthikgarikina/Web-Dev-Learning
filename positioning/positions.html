    The expression i.find(temp) != std::string::npos is a common way to check if a substring (temp) exists within a string (i) in C++.
    
    Explanation:
    find Function:
    
    i.find(temp) searches for the first occurrence of the substring temp in the string i.
    If temp is found, it returns the index of the first character of temp within i.
    If temp is not found, it returns std::string::npos.
    std::string::npos:
    
    std::string::npos is a constant defined in the std::string class. It represents an invalid position or "not found."
    Its exact value is typically the largest possible value of std::size_t (an unsigned integer type).
    != std::string::npos:
    
    This checks whether the result of i.find(temp) is not equal to std::string::npos, meaning that the substring temp was found somewhere within the string i.
    Example:
    cpp
    Copy
    Edit
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    
    int main() {
        std::string i = "hello world";
        std::string temp = "world";
    
        if (i.find(temp) != std::string::npos) {
            std::cout << "'" << temp << "' is found in '" << i << "'.\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "'" << temp << "' is not found in '" << i << "'.\n";
        }
    
        return 0;
    }
    Output:
    csharp
    Copy
    Edit
    'world' is found in 'hello world'.
    Use Cases:
    Substring Check:
    To see if a string contains another string.
    Position Retrieval:
    If you need to know the exact position where the substring starts, you can directly use the result of find.
    Example:
    cpp
    Copy
    Edit
    size_t pos = i.find(temp);
    if (pos != std::string::npos) {
        std::cout << "Found '" << temp << "' at position " << pos << ".\n";
    }
    Output:
    arduino
    Copy
    Edit
    Found 'world' at position 6.
    Edge Cases:
    Empty temp:
    If temp is an empty string, find always returns 0, as an empty string is considered to be found at the beginning of any string.
    Example:
    cpp
    Copy
    Edit
    std::string i = "hello";
    std::cout << i.find("") << std::endl; // Outputs 0
    temp Larger Than i:
    If temp is longer than i, find always returns std::string::npos.
    Case Sensitivity:
    find is case-sensitive. To perform a case-insensitive search, additional logic is needed (e.g., converting both strings to lowercase).
    Comparison with ==:
    If you are only looking for an exact match, you should use == instead of find.
    Example:
    cpp
    Copy
    Edit
    if (i == temp) {
        std::cout << "Strings are exactly equal.\n";
    }
    find is used when you're looking for a substring, not an exact match.
